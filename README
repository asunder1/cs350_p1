ADDED MKDIR2 SYSTEM CALL:
almost the same as shutdown, but implementation in sysfile.c instead of sysproc.c since that is where similar file-related system calls are like mkdir

arguments are passed to wrapper function, but can be accessed via functions defined in syscall.c - namely argstr to grab an argument string which is the one relevant for this function

ADDING SHUTDOWN SYSTEM CALL:
added user space function declaration to user.h

implemented actual code for shutdown system call in sysproc.c

assigned system call number in syscall.h

linked system call number to its function by adding to syscall.c

added the system call stub for user space by adding to usys.S
